# Todo App Using VueJs

## Description
This is a todo app using VueJs and JavaScript. Find the deployed link [here](https://spiffy-sorbet-71334a.netlify.app/). Also, [here is the video demonstration](https://drive.google.com/file/d/156vfwpnJDs-ZAC0xgPMu9pfEP6RXUlzE/view?usp=sharing) on what you can do with the app. The todo app has the following functionalities;
1. A user can add new todos
2. A user can mark certain todos as completed
3. One can filter todos based on whether they have been completed or not completed. Also, one can simply view all todos regardless of whether they have been completed or not
4. One can clear all completed todos. Doing this means it will be cleared from all todos. Therefore, the todos won't appear when one clicks on "all todos"
5. Toggle between light and dark mode

Besides the functionalities mentioned above, the app is also responsive. It changes to the best format depending on the screen size thereby enabling the best experience.

## Running the Project Locally on Your Machine
### Setup Requirements
You can experience the app by visiting the link [here](https://spiffy-sorbet-71334a.netlify.app/). Alternatively (and especially if you want to modify implementations), you can clone the repo and work on it locally. Before you do that, ensure you have the following installed;
1. npm
2. vue-3

### Setup Instructions
Follow the following steps to run the code locally on your machine;
1. `git clone https://github.com/VinceXIV/todo-app--vuejs`
2. `cd todo-app--vuejs`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run serve`

After running the commands above, the project will be built and serve on port 8080 of your machine by default. It will be in the form; _http://localhost:8080/_. You can then just copy it and paste on your browser url section to run the project. If you need to see changes you make on your code, you can just open the project using your favorite text editor (mine is VS Code), and edit. Each change you make will automatically lead to it being incorporated in what will be served so you won't need to reload the page or run `npm run serve` again.
